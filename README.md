# C-Projects

C is a general-purpose computer programming language.
It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential.
Here, are some of the C programs created by me.

## Programs

| **SL NO** | **Program**                                                                                                    | **File**                                                 |

| 2         | Write a program to read and print integer values                                                               | [read_print_int.c](/data/read_print_int.c)               |
| 3         | Write a program to add two integer numbers                                                                     | [addition.c](/data/addition.c)                           |
| 4         | Write a program to print your own name by giving user input                                                    | [name_user_input.c](/data/name_user_input.c)             |
| 5         | Write a program to perform the arithmetic operations ( +, -, \*, /, %) of two integers and display the result. | [arithmetic_operations.c](/data/arithmetic_operations.c) |

| 7         | Write a program to convert centigrade to fahrenheit                                                            | [temp_conv2.c](/data/temp_conv2.c)                       |
| 8         | Write a program to calculate area of a circle                                                                  | [area_circle.c](/data/area_circle.c)                     |
| 9         | Write a program to calculate area of a triangle                                                                | [area_triangle.c](/data/area_triangle.c)                 |

## Algorithms

These will be added later on.
